# Cypress.io_End-to-End_JStests

An End-to-End Javascript web application testing project using Cypress.io to enable UI Test automation.

# Prerequisites to understand this project

- Good foundation in Javascript syntax: the modern ES6 syntax
- Passion for software quality

# Software/Tool Installation

1. Install Node.js (https://www.nodejs.org) and check installation by `$ node --version`
2. Make sure most recent version of NPM is installed (install most recent version of NPM by `$ npm install -g npm`) and then check installation using `$ npm --version`

- If the above steps face issues regarding permission denial, then run all same commands with <b>sudo</b> in front.

# Introduction to Cypress.io

- <b>Cypress.io<b> - very easy-to-use open-source and free library that allows us to conduct the automated testing (sometimes easier to use than other end-to-end frameworks like Selenium).
- Hence, Cypress.io is a tool that allows us to automate and scale end-to-end testing and ensure our application works correctly under almost all the circumstances a user will encounter.
- Manually testing all elements of a web and then shipping it into production doesn’t scale well. As the application becomes bigger and bigger, it becomes extremely impractical for the developers to test the entire web app on their own. Developers become limited to testing only the new functionality they added and hoping they didn’t break another part of the web app - this is the point where companies hire <b>QA Engineers</b>.
- Therefore, manual testing is neither a scalable nor an efficient way to ensure software quality from the end user’s point of view.
- Automate testing is the best option in this case - we want tests that represent the user’s point of view of application.
- Automated tests can be doing actions like clicking buttons and typing into text boxes and checking if certain elements are visible on the web page - instead of calling the code directly.
- This branch of testing is called <b>End-to-End testing</b> or <b>UI Testing</b> - extremely important in ensuring that the users of the app have a good experience and that visible bugs are caught before they make it into production.
